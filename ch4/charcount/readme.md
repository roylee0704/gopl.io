## charcount

Charcount is a program that reads strings from standard-input: your terminal, and then produce a frequency table of characters (in unicode form).

Meaning, it is able to accept characters other than ASCII.


## Getting started
```sh
$ charcount
hello world
```

Program stops taking input when user signals `EOF`: `ctrl-D`.
